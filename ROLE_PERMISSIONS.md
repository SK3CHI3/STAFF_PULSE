    );

-- HR admins can only access their organization
CREATE POLICY "HR admins organization access" ON table_name
    FOR ALL USING (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM profiles 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'hr_admin'
        )

  if (userRole === 'super_admin' && endpoint.includes('/whatsapp/send')) {
    return { allowed: false, reason: 'Super admins cannot send messages' }
  }
  return { allowed: true }
