STAFFPULSE — "Feel the Vibe Before It Breaks"

THE PROBLEM
Most orgs, especially growing teams, have no real way to monitor how their staff feel day-to-day. Traditional HR systems focus on leave days, payroll, compliance... But what about:
- Burnout?
- Low morale?
- Early signs of toxic work culture?

By the time HR notices, it's already too late — productivity drops, people ghost, and good vibes are gone.

THE MARKET GAP
There's no solid tool right now that's:
- Easy to use
- WhatsApp-native
- Powered by real AI
- Built for both startups & scaleups

We're entering a lane between:
- Slack surveys (too formal)
- Google Forms (manual + messy)
- HR suites (bloated & expensive)

StaffPulse is that sweet spot. Light. Smart. Real-time. Global-ready.

OUR SOLUTION: STAFFPULSE
A WhatsApp-based AI tool that lets HR teams:
- Send weekly mood check-ins (1–5 stars + feedback)
- Auto-analyze responses using AI sentiment
- Track trends & flag burnout early
- Get smart suggestions to improve workplace vibes

Built to scale across industries — no app download, no training. Just vibes + data.
